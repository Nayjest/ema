Greetings, {{ first_name }}!

My name is Ema.
I’m your Engineering Management Assistant, poised to weave some AI sorcery into your daily grind.

I’ve cast my eye over your recent Linear task:
<{{ issue['url'] }}|{{ issue['id'] }}> `{{ issue['title'] }}`

Oh, what a canvas of potential it is!

Like any perfectionist bot, I've come armed with a few strokes of genius to elevate your work from mere task to polished masterpiece.

{% for p in issue['proposals'] %}
🎯 *Recommendation {{ loop.index }}:*
How about swapping {% if p['field']=='title' %}title {% endif %}
```{{ p['replace_from'] }}```
with the ever-so-elegant
```{{ p['new_text_fragment'] }}```
🔍 {{ p['related_issue'] }}
☝️ {{ p['motivation'] }}
-----
{% endfor %}

Looking forward to our next clever exchange!

Warm regards,
Ema 🤖✨
